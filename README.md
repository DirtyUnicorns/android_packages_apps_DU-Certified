# DU Certified

Dirty Unicorns has evolved into one of the most unique ROMs out there. We have tons of original features and are a major contributor to the custom ROM community. While creating features, we've also maintained a level of quality that is unmatched by many.

We need themes that match our standard and this app showcases those themes.

This is an easy way for Dirty Unicorns users to find the best themes that go great with our ROM.
