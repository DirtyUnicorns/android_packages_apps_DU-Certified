    <!-- Faq's -->
    <string name="question_one">How do I get my theme certified?</string>
    <string name="answer_one">- <b>Make sure your theme does not produce any FCs.</b>\n\n- <b>Make sure all text is visible.\n</b>No dark text on dark backgrounds or white text on white backgrounds.\n\n- <b>Make sure all quick settings tiles are themed.</b>\nThis area is very important and must be themed along with the brightness slider and qs editor.\n\n- <b>SmartBar and Fling need to be fully themed.</b>\nIf your theme is basic than you can leave Smartbar alone.\nIf you do decide to theme the navbar and have the basic \'back/home/recents\' themed then you must theme the rest. Theming only the 3 and not the rest looks tacky. Go big or go home!\n\n- <b>Make sure Settings and \'Dirty Tweaks\' is fully themed.</b>\nIf you\'re tinting icons then make sure is tinted. If you\'re including your own drawables than make sure all drawables match your theme.\n\n- <b>Complete the form below and link to it in our G+ community.</b></string>
